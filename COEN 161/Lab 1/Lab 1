Part 1 (50 pts)
Here you will practice setting up a webpage on the student webpages server.

Open the terminal and change into your webpages directory
cd /webpages/<username>
Create a directory called coen161
mkdir coen161
Download the index.html file and copy it into your new directory
Open a browser and go to your new webpage
http://students.engr.scu.edu/~<username>/coen161/index.html (Links to an external site.)
Check the permissions of your coen161 directory files
ls -la
You should see something like -rw-r--r-- in front of each file
Note: Directories start with d, drwx------
Note: The . directory is your current directory
Change the permissions of your directory and any files that don't have read permissions for everyone
the chmod command lets you set the permissions of a file or directory
chmod 777 -  the 3 numbers represent permissions for user, group, and world respectively
Permissions have the following values
4 -  read
2 - write
1 - execute
7 - all permissions
6 - read & write
5 - read & execute
3 - write & execute
chmod 700 myfile - gives you all permissions to myfile and no permissions for everyone else
chmod 755 myfile - gives you all permissions to myfile and read & execute permissions for everyone else
Note: Never give write access to anyone other than yourself because then anyone can go and change your files
Check your page in the browser, you should be able to see it at this point
Follow the comments to personalize your new page
If you're comfortable with it, feel free to add some styling to the page (optional)
